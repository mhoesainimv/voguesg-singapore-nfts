    "description":"<p>For the September issue of <i>Vogue</i> Singapore, you would have noticed a large QR code on our print cover. However, we don’t actually have a print cover at all. Rather, it serves as a portal to the two digital-only covers that we've created in collaboration with local and international digital artists—the protagonists driving the new creative renaissance born out of NFTs.</p><p>Here, we are proud to present one of the two virtual-only covers: 'Triumphant Awakening' by 3D artist Chad Knight in collaboration with Singapore design studio Baëlf Design, who created the AI-generated fractal headpiece. This cover artwork can also be purchased as a one-of-one NFT.</p><p>Welcome to our historic NFT issue. Welcome to a new dawn.</p>",
